# That Classical Timeline

[That Classical Podcast](tcp) is a podcast about classical music
I started listening a couple of months back. What makes this
podcast special is the fact that Kelly and Chris (the hosts)
talk about classical music in such a fun and engaging way. It is,
by no means, anything similar to any other classical music podcast
or radio station.

I thought it would be interesting to keep track of all the
composers and pieces they mention, and to do so in a visual way.
